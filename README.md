# High level algorithm:
Word seperation based on different delimiter such as ",/,[,],'... & Case IN-sensitive.

1) Open document 
2) Use Map and List to seperate the words 
3) If the word already exists in teh List, increment the count of frequency. else new word
4) Use Collection to sort the list on the basis of frequency of usage. 
5) Print the list & Entry.getKey (max count word) & its Entry.getValue (max count)

# Java Code with -
Collection adn Map which solving this problem statement with easy operations and efficiently.
