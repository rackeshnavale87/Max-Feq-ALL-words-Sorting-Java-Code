# High level algorithm:
Word seperation based on different delimiter such as ",/,[,],'... & Case IN-sensitive.

1) Open document 
2) Read words and add them to Single linked list. (avoid using Double LL to get rid of extra overhead) 
3) If the word already exists in teh list, increment the count of frequency. 
4) Sort the list on the basis of frequency of usage. 
5) Print the list.
